 ## How are we doing this ?
 Bharatanve Campus Lead Program recognises the significance of young Student Leaders who proactively identify problems faced by students in their campus and are passionate about helping their Student Community to grow in any way possible. This requires Campus Leads to bridge the gap between students and industry to improve the learning experience of students in the campus. And to do so, we support Campus Leads in bringing such opportunities that connect students with industry experts by organising events that provide practical exposure to the students and enhance their learning experience in the campus.
 
 With a chance to work together and learn from experienced professionals and industry partners, we help Campus Leads to get the right exposure and skills to emerge as Leaders and help them face all the challenges, achieve their goals and better serve their Student Community.
