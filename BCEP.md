  ### Why join Bharatanve Campus Experience Program ?
  Identifying problems and solving them with strategic approach is what students lack now a days. The current way of rote learning is depriving them to have such qualities which is making students to loose the curiosity factor and also the greater opportunities. Because the rote learning 

1. Does not allow students to explore various ways of solving a problem and identifying the existing problems.
2. Disconnects students from understanding the significance and need of pure and applied research.

Bharatanve Campus Experience Program (BCEP) is an initiative that will allow students to hands-on experience real-world problems by connecting them to Industry partners which will allow students to learn from industry level professionals, work on real life projects and participate in Research & Development of products and services that run the world.

This program aims to develop problem identification & solving abilities aided with strategic approach within students which will lead to increase in innovation of new generation products and services.
