## Impact of our Mission
The way of learning through 'Research and Development'(R&D) and 'Case Study' is the core of Bharatanve's mission of Re-Engineering the way of Learning. This way of Learning any concepts allows students to work on real-world problems and develop a mindset of a problem solver. This mindset when inculcated within students creates next generation entrepreneurs and students with a clarity and command over their skillset and career choices.  
We consider it as our responsibility to provide right opportunities to such students and entrepreneurs. For this, we introduced 'Work at a Startup' initiative.
